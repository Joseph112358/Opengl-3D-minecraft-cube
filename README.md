# Opengl-3D-minecraft-cube
<p>This is my 3D minecraft cube project. Essentially, the aim of the project is to render a simple 3D block (grass block) in a window use Opengl and standard C++. The framework for this is loosely based on the Youtube tutorial series by Victor Gordon [(found here)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-)
